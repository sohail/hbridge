# H Bridge electronic circuit

H-Bridge is an electronic circuit that switches the polarity of voltage applied to a load.

Given the fact that by changing the direction of the rotation the DC motors can run with either polarity. An H bridge is an electronic circuit which can be used to switch the polarity of a attached motor, thus making the motor run forward and in backwards direction.
